%%%% Reviewer comments
% code gives Unrecognized function or variable 'calculate_currents'
% code reads very well and varibles are well defined
% code comments are great, and provide support for the well defined
% varibles
%varibles are well defined and are in line with the problem solved
%the range of varibles used defines the problem well
%Given the explicit nature of the varibles I can visulize whats going on

%code might need semicolons to suppress out put on some lines
