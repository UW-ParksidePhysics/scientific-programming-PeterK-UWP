"""
Review of if name = main
    This if statement is used at the bottom of each python file as a test block for the file.
    The file should have everything inside of definition statements.
    When you call the function to another python file, the other file will see that the if statement is false,
    thus only picking up the definition statements and only running the code from the ran file.
